        &emsp;&emsp;AccessiScan is an innovative solution to the persistent
        challenges in web accessibility. By scanning websites directly from a
        Chrome extension, AccessiScan enables developers to proactively address
        accessibility during the design phase, even on local, unpublished
        websites. This unique approach offers developers early visibility into
        potential accessibility issues, such as visual, audio, and mobility
        barriers, empowering them to create inclusive experiences from the
        start.
        <br />
        <br />
        &emsp;&emsp;AccessiScan aims not only to identify compliance gaps and
        provide free, user-friendly accessibility reports but also to serve as a
        comprehensive educational tool. Developers are guided in understanding
        what accessibility entails and how to implement it effectively. Our tool
        generates an accessibility score based on various criteria, helping
        developers learn while they improve their projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        &emsp;&emsp;Additionally, AccessiScan fosters a community of
        accessibility-focused creators through its integrated community board.
        This space allows developers to share insights, discuss projects, and
        seek advice, creating a supportive environment that promotes accessible
        design practices. On the Home page, we have curated accessibility
        resources to offer indepth explanations and recommendations. Together,
        AccessiScanâ€™s tools and community provide a unique platform for
        educating, connecting, and empowering developers to make the web more
        accessible for all.
